# Load any settings specific to the current user.
# .bazelrc.user should appear in .gitignore so that settings are not shared with team members
# This needs to be last statement in this
# config, as the user configuration should be able to overwrite flags from this file.
# See https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/best-practices.html#bazelrc
# (Note that we use .bazelrc.user so the file appears next to .bazelrc in directory listing,
# rather than user.bazelrc as suggested in the Bazel docs)
